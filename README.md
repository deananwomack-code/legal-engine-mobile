# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory, which already includes a basic [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) layout. The starter screen is located at `app/index.tsx`, and the stack navigator is defined in `app/_layout.tsx`.

If you want a blank slate, you can move the current starter into `app-example/` and recreate an empty `app/` folder with:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This script lives at `scripts/reset-project.js` and only operates on the `app/` and `app-example/` directories in the project root.
